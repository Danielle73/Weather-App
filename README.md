## Overview

This is a simple weather app that uses open weather api to get the weather conditions of a searched location. When a location is searched for, it returns the weather info in celsius, humidity, wind speed etc. I used a case switch statement to return a phrase specific to whether or not the temperature for the day was greater than a number set. For example, temp >= 25 returned the message 'Its hot, Wear Sunscreen', as well as a small weather related icon. 

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- Openweather api 

### What I learned

This was a good project into working with api's, as well as strengthening skills such as using case switch statements. 

### Continued development

To recreate this app with React.
Improve functionality; due to api being hosted locally, this affects interactivity and usability.
